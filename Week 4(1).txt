A small clinic uses a simple information system to manage its daily operations. The system stores information about patients, doctors, and their appointments. Patient records include basic details such as name, age, gender, and contact number, while doctor records include name and medical specialization.Clinic staff use the system to view patient details and identify senior patients who are over 65 years old so they can receive priority care. The system also helps staff manage doctor information and find out how many doctors specialize in a particular field, such as ophthalmology. Overall, the system helps keep clinic records organized and improves efficiency in managing patients and doctors.
